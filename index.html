              <p> The Second Annual Kellogg Part-Time MBA trip was a great success this year! Forty-five students, alumni, and friends traveled to Park City, UT for a 3-day ski trip to forge new bonds between new and old students.

                  <p>We arrived at Park City, UT at noon on Friday, 1/15/2015, and settled into our condo. Old Kellogg friends and new enjoyed some relaxing time in the hot tub, followed by a group dinner. After dinner, the costume party began and we danced the night away.</p>

                  <p>Located in the north side community area of Lakeview, Wrigley Field sits on an irregular block bounded by Clark (west) and Addison (south) Streets and Waveland (north) and Sheffield (east) Avenues. Wrigley Field is nicknamed The Friendly Confines, a phrase popularized by "Mr. Cub", Hall of Famer Ernie Banks. The current seating capacity is 42,495. It is the oldest National League ballpark, the second-oldest active major league ballpark (after Fenway Park on April 20, 1912), and the only remaining Federal League park.</p>
